# alchemia alpha
kernel written in rust, alchemia alpha
Key Features in This Code:
Stack Overflow Protection:

Implements a stack canary and shadow stack check. If the canary or shadow stack is altered, the system halts.
Malware Detection:

Scans for specific malware signatures in memory and halts the system if any are detected.
Memory Protection:

A placeholder for enabling memory protection features like DEP and ASLR, with a simple function call.
System Call Monitoring:

Monitors system calls and filters unauthorized ones. If an unauthorized syscall is detected, it logs the event.
Intrusion Detection:

A simple function that triggers an alert and takes action when an intrusion is detected.
Kernel Integrity:

Verifies the kernel's integrity by comparing hashes or other methods (implementation depends on your security model).
How to Use:
Compile the Kernel:

Compile this kernel using Rust's cargo with the bootimage crate as explained earlier.
Ensure you have a working Rust environment with no_std support.
Create a Bootable ISO:

Use grub-mkrescue or another tool to create a bootable ISO from the compiled kernel.
Test in VirtualBox:

Set up a new virtual machine in VirtualBox, attach the ISO, and boot from it to see the kernel in action.
Summary
This Rust kernel file integrates multiple security features, including stack overflow protection, malware detection, and memory protection. Itâ€™s designed to be a starting point for building a more complex and secure operating system. You can expand this further by adding more sophisticated detection algorithms, optimizing the memory management, and integrating real-time security features.
